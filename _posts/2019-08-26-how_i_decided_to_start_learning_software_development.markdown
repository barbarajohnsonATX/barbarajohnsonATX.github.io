As an application engineer in the semiconductor industry, my job is to support customers integrate our microprocessors into their applications. Programming is done at the register level. It is very hardware-centric. I have to interact closely with the hardware so I need to know how the hardware works. Most of the programs I write are for managing and controlling the hardware. For example, I have written code in embedded C or scripts to test data throughput. Debugging involves not only using breakpoints but most of the time I have to use oscilloscopes and traffic analzyers. 

After 20+ years, I wanted to make my transition into software development. I would like to move away from the semiconductor company. I've always enjoyed writing software. As a kid in the 80s, I had a Commodore computer and I remember writing BASIC code to make beeping sounds out of our CRT TV. In college I took C and Fortran (LOL). I've also taken Java and Swift classes as personal interests outside of work. The Flatiron online sotware engineering program allows me to pursue software development while I also keep my full-time job. I'm excited for this learning journey for the next several months. I am amazed how much I have already learned and cannot wait to learn more.
