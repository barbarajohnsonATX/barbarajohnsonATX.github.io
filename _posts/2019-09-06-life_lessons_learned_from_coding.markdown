Here are some lessons I learned from coding:

1. Patience is a virtue. I'm too embarrassed to say how long it took me to notice a missing semi-colon.

2. You have to learn to adapt and keep learning, otherwise you get left behind. Remember Pascal and BASIC? 

3. Making mistakes is OK. I will ALWAYS make mistakes. The goal is to not repeat the same mistakes. I can accpet making new mistakes.

4.  Avoid doing the same thing multiple times. Instead of taking 3 left turns, why not just take a right turn?  

5.  When you have a huge task that seems overwhelming, break it down into smaller tasks. Retiring early seems like an impossible goal, so maybe start with smaller, manageable goals like paying off debt, putting more money into retirement, etc. Just like coding, you can start with smaller modules, test it and then build on it.

6.  Write clear documentation. Do you know how annoyed I would be if I inherited someone else's convoluted code with no documentation?

7.  Organize things where they belong, like the MVC concept, to reduce complexity.

8.  Learn from and help others. Programming forums are a great resource for knowledge.

9.  Details are important to know but sometimes abstracting out details is important.

10.  Be receptive to other people's feedback. Code reviews can point out areas for improvement.
