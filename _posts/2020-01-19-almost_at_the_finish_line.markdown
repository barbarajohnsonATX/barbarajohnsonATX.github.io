I have just scheduled my React-Redux final project assessment so this feels like running that last 0.2 miles of a 26.2 mile marathon. It's hard to believe I'm almost there. I enrolled in the self-paced program at the end of March 2019. I have a job as an senior engineer (background is electrical engineering in the semiconductor industry) so a pay increase was not my motiviation. 

A few things factored into my decision: 
* I have always liked programming. I was introduced to BASIC in elementary school in the 80s, back when the family television was also the computer monitor if you turn to channel 3. 
* I am a forever student and I like the idea of constantly learning new things. I have taken many classes online and at the local community college to learn something new: Java, IOS programming. I'll be that token old lady classmate. 
* My job can be boring so this is an escape for me. Sometimes I do more non-engineering tasks than actual engineering work and it is taxing.
* My son is away at college and I had a lot of maternal energy so I wanted to use my time to develop new skills. 

So what do I want to do after completing the Software Engineering Bootcamp? The most important goal for me is to maintain and improve my skills. I plan to create more apps and make sure I am active on Github. The right full-stack developer job would be a plus. If a developer job opens up at my current workplace, I would apply so I can keep my benefits.

For those who are considering enrolling in the bootcamp or those who are new students, I would advise to take your time to learn. Supplement your learning with online video training, read other people's blogs,  get help on programming forums. Take regular breaks or you will burn out. You don't want to start too fast and run out of gas at the 13 mile mark.
